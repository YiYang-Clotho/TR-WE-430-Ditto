          <b>Background and passion: <br /> </b>students from China. Now it's my   

          second year in it. I learned some coding when I was in China. In the IT industry, I 
          
           prefer to analyze data through code. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Current ability:<br /> </b> I have learned several coding languages, including C, 

          Java and python. At present, I'm learning springboot. In addition, I have a certain 
         
          understanding of database development. I have a strong interest in convenient 
         
          development of research framework 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Weak points:<br /> </b> Although I have learned a lot of programming languages, I 

          almost forget how to use them, and the content is very basic. The only thing I 
         
          remember is Java. I want to exercise my ability to use java language through this 
         
          project and make Java my main language. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The areas in need of development:</b>
          <br />
          the most important aspect that needs to be 

          strengthened is the ability to learn alone, which is usually led by the teacher, but 
         
          this time it needs to be completed by myself. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Challenges:</b> <br />
          It's a challenge to design a full-featured application, because I've 

          never dealt with an application completely. Using new tools that have not been 
         
          used before is also a challenge 
        </p>
        <p>
       <b>Tasks:</b>    <br />
          I can write documents, database design, part of the function can be 

          achieved, project presentation
