            Motivation
        </h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Our team started the project with a first-team meeting discussing the main topic and what kind of IT system
            we will develop. After discussion, we decided to develop a Web application mainly because all of the team
            members have related web developing experience and knew basic developing knowledge like HTML, JS and
            Bootstrap. Regarding the topic, we decided to take Gia’s Intro to IT’s project idea, which is to develop a
            recipe website. After that, we went into the planning phase.</p>

        <p>During the planning phase, we took some original functions from Gia’s project idea. And we also added some
            more
            functions to this project. For example, we considered during the epidemic time, people can’t go out and have
            to
            cook themselves. With Dr.B’s suggestion, we decided to add a Pantry function which allows the user to input
            ingredients first and the system will offer related recipes. Besides, when we looked through some existing
            websites, we noticed that although they offered steps to help users cook, it is still hard to follow without
            pictures’ assistance. Therefore, when designing the step-by-step page, we decided to add some procedure
            pictures
            to help users to understand. After several meetings to debate and exchange ideas, we finally defined the
            scope
            of the whole project and we chose some functions as MVFs which we have the confidence to realize in the
            future,
            for others, they are considered as EVFs which we will develop if time permits.</p>

        <p>After planning, we moved to the designing phase. We decided to use Invision to make a mock-up. This part did
            not
            go that well as we expected. Firstly, some teams were not very familiar with Invision. It took us more time
            to
            learn to use this Studio. And it is hard to track those studio files with Github. Therefore, we assigned
            each
            member an independent page to design and put all sections together. Besides, we also used LucidChart to
            design
            the ER diagram for building databases. In this phase, we also learned the basics about SpringBoot Frame and
            Maven then set up the environment for further development.</p>
        <p> Regarding the implementation phase, we encountered some major problems. First of all, it took extra time to
            study related knowledge like Thymeleaf and MyBaits. About Thymeleaf, we used this technology to make the
            website
            interactive, which we could leave spaces for recognition in the HTML page and fill those with recipe data.
            For
            MyBaits, it could offer us some methods to connect with databases, which is convenient and we don’t have to
            write SQL commands. We had plenty of errors when trying to implement them and spent lots of time debugging
            and
            trying to make sure codes could run as expected. Second, we had a major delay due to the problem of losing
            control of our online database. We accidentally uploaded our application configuration file which contains
            our
            online database’s address and password. Later, we found that all the tables had been locked and the hacker
            left
            us a warning to pay to get our tables back. Due to this reason, we changed our plan to slow down our coding
            process to rebuild a new database.
        </p>
        <p> Luckily, after having multiple team meetings, we still caught up with the schedule and realized all the
            MVFs. We
            use the docker to deploy our website to AWS platform. The only thing that bothers us is that we have to
            change
            the key periodically to reconnect with AWS so we can add recipes.
        </p>


        <p> All in all, the whole process went pretty well even though we met some major challenges. We managed to
            achieve
            all the MVFs and designed EVFs for further development. About dead-ends, we changed some functionalities’
            performance, for example, we firstly designed the Pantry function to let users choose ingredients and the
            website will update on the main page automatically. But we found that too challenging, therefore, we
            adjusted
            this function to display the results recipes only. Although using new technologies could lead us to many
            unexpected bugs, we still appreciate this very opportunity to gain knowledge and experience along the way.
            For
            the team working, some members are not as active as others and sometimes we have to revise others’ work. We
            still managed to solve this by compromising and holding meetings to exchange ideas. Finally, we learned
            valuable
            lessons by developing this project.</p>
        <h2>Extended Viable Feature</h2>
        <p>We decided to present this part in a different section. You can check this section in the navbar.</p>
        <h2>Scope creep</h2>
        <p>Thanks to the detailed planning at the beginning of this project, we did not change the scope of the project.
            However, we did some adjustments on the MVFs, firstly we did not specify the US which is epic. After having
            team meetings, we clarified those features and drew a conclusion on how to realize those functionalities.
            And during the implementation phase, we did consider changing the scope because our online database was
            hacked and we need extra time to fix that. At last, we held a meeting and decided not to change and continue
            coding.
        </p>
        <h2>Windfall</h2>
        <p>About windfall, we did realize MVF2 earlier than our exceptions, originally we thought it would be hard to
            create a slider which could change recipe pictures automatically. After looking through some resources, we
            found it easy to be accomplished by using the Bootstrap carousel indicator. Everything else is all on track
            and finished according to schedule.
        </p>
        <h2>Progress</h2>
        <p>When developing our project, we followed the estimation form to help us monitor the progress. Regarding
            results, some of MVFs are ahead of the timetable, and about later development, we encountered a problem with
            the online database. Therefore, we had multiple delays for that part. Eventually, we finished all the MVFs
            and detailed progress information are listed below, sorted by MVFs.

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p> During the designing phase, we did usability testing. When we finished the mock-up, we presented it to the
            tutor and asked him for opinions. We did some changes on editing button icons and did some more formatting
            to make our mock-up more formal.</p>

        <p>For the back end, we used SpringBoot to test all the methods. Firstly, we did not pass the testing, it
            reported there were some bugs, after debugging, we managed to pass all the test units.</p>

        <p>For the front end, we test all the functionalities manually by following the user stories’ acceptance
            criteria and see if we could achieve the goal. During the testing, we found some user stories maybe still
            too epic and we specified it into some detailed user stories. After that, we finished all of the testings,
            and the website performed as we expected.</p>
