        <h1>PROJECT PROCESSES
        </h1>
        <h2>What we have learned</h2>
        <p>The new tools and technologies we have learned have been mentioned in another section, so this part we will
            introduce what we have learned about the performance as a team in particular. In view of the fact that it is
            the first time for some members to complete the project as a team, of course, everyone can learn about the
            performance during this semester. As a team, we cooperate well together in general. Most members are willing
            to listen to the opinions of others and actively accept others’ suggestions. In the first assignment, we
            made a general arrangement of the project, and then in the second one, we made detailed supplements to the
            plan of the project, specific to what tasks each person should complete each week.
        </p>
        <p>What works well in the group is that members can take the initiative and complete the task on time and open
            it to GitHub and update the Trello cards to let others know the progress of the tasks. However, what hasn’t
            worked well is that Gia always needs other people to assign work and will not take the initiative to
            complete the task. At the same time, he also needs the supervision of others to finish the task on time. Not
            only that, he is not willing to accept the opinions of others, so the efficiency of communication with him
            is always low because he may not be good at cooperating with others. Even so, others tried their best to
            communicate with him and did extra work which he can not do well to make sure the project is in progress and
            the project finished well as expected.
        </p>

        <h2>Lecturer, Mentor and communication</h2>
        <p>We have meetings with the mentor every week in which we showed our progress, achievements and the questions
            then he gave us his suggestions and told us which parts could have an improvement. Specifically, Trevor
            helped us a lot on designing the website and mentioned that we lost the author on the recipe detail page,
            furthermore, he reminded us to mention about the feature creeps in the report when we did that without
            realising. On the other hand, the lecturer guided us in setting the project topic. As mentioned before, our
            project is based on Gia’s Intro to IT assignment but this time we have to consider the achievements of the
            functions and its feasibility. At the beginning, we set the posting recipes as the key feature of the
            website but Dr.B suggested that we should do something unique such as achieve a different searching system
            as the key point. We agreed and listened to his advice.
        </p>
        <p>The group holds weekly meetings as required, during which, every member firstly shows what have done of
            previous tasks and others helped check and review the task then assigns new tasks for next week and sets a
            due date for them. At other times, most of the members could complete the work independently. Otherwise, if
            we are available, we will hold extra meetings to do oral communication directly, if not, we will post
            messages in general channels. The team will also review an additional time before the meeting with the
            mentor to make sure that we can show our progress properly. At the beginning of the semester, we usually
            have a weekly meeting on Monday or Tuesday, but later the regular meeting was changed to Friday because we
            have a meeting with the mentor on Wednesday and before that, we always hold a meeting that would not be
            recorded, in order to ensure the frequency and the quality of the meeting we change it to Friday.</p>
        <h2>aspect of organising a project and hindsight</h2>
        <p>For my perspective, the most aspect of organising a project of this nature is to learn the project management
            and learn to work as a team because in the real industry people have to work together, it is a challenge for
            a group of beginner to work in this way but it is also a excellent chance for us to improve not only the
            coding skills but also the collaborating skill. If I have a chance to start the project again, I hope I can
            make more contributions to code and spend more time learning more deeply on Spring boot and Mybatis, because
            after all as a programmer, code ability is the most important.</p>
        <h2>advice</h2>
        <p>My advice for a group about to embark on a similar project is that it is inevitable that you will encounter
            teammates who are not actively completing the task or difficult to communicate with. It is better to stop
            loss in time and the wrong approach if it is possible. Otherwise, other team members should jointly decide
            whether the non-working person should stay in the group. It might happen the same in the real industry,
            however, the boss will consider it at that time. So for those who will participate in a similar project,
            members have their rights to keep only those who are willing to work hard.</p>
