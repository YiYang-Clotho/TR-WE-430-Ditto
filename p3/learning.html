        <h1>What found easy? difficult? how to fix?</h1>
        <p>In this project, user stories design is easier than other parts. The most difficult part of our project is
            function implementing. Though spring boot is one of the best Java frameworks in the world. We still met some
            problems in how to set up the authority management. For example, we try to use jwt (java web token) to
            authorize the users. The most common solution is to put the token to the header using Axios (an HTTP request
            lib) and send it to the server, but we use thymeleaf to build our interface rather than react.js or vue.js.
            Therefore it is hard to put the web token to the request’s header and send it to the spring boot. After the
            discussion in the meeting, we chose to put the token to request cookies and set an interceptor function to
            get requests and verify the token in the cookie. Another unexpected and difficult part is to implement file
            upload functionality. Firstly, we prefer to store recipe pictures and avatars locally. However, we can not
            share recipes. So we selected a s3 bucket and learned AWS SDK to store pictures online.
        </p>
        <h1>expecting Challenges</h1>
        <p>
            One of the challenges we expect is feature implementation including data delivery between the browser and
            the server. Thymeleaf and HTML only support “get” and “post” HTTP requests. So we chose Axios to send HTTP
            requests from the front end. We also did lots of research to allow the server to receive data properly.
            Another challenge we expect is interaction functionality. We find lots of material and tutorials to learn
            javascript because javascript is very useful to build a dynamic web page and improve user experiences such
            as error prevention and animation. The last challenge we expect is the user interface. We must know HTML and
            CSS a lot to build a user-friendly interface, so we learn flex to plan web pages’ layouts and learn
            bootstrap to build a proper interface for our system.
        </p>
        <h1>what we learned</h1>
        <p>We learned a lot from this course. First is communication. In order to implement our system “Cookiez”, we
            have to collaborate to design the system, to discuss user stories, to distribute tasks and so on. We have a
            weekly meeting which allows us to share what we have done and review the work we have done. This is an
            excellent chance to exercise our ability to describe something. Besides, we learned how to take advantage of
            AWS to help us to develop our project. We realize what ACI(Access Control Information) is and can set access
            control for the public. In terms of EC2, we do lots of research to deploy our project on a Linux server.
            Finally, we chose docker as our solution because docker is popular in the industry and there are many
            tutorials about docker. We also learn RDS in aws because we need to synchronize our data.
        </p>
        <h1>hindsight</h1>
        <p>Plan changed in the feature implementation part. In hindsight, we still need to change our plan due to lack
            of project experience. Several use stories have to be modified. If there is one thing over again, we hope we
            can design user stories carefully and precisely with more acceptance criteria. We should learn more web
            programming technologies and concepts like spring boot, MVC, restful and so on. JavaScript is also very
            important but we did not use this web language skillfully.
        </p>
        <h1>About timetable </h1>
        <p>As a whole, our timetable is realistic. We seldom meet unexpected events such as underestimated tasks and
            deadlines from other courses. When unexpected events break our timetable, we always hold an emergency
            meeting to distribute tasks again to limit the negative influence as soon as possible. For example, when we
            are implementing the “add recipe” feature, Zhihao cannot finish his job on time. Therefore we hold a meeting
            to let Heran help Zhihao to implement the feature.
        </p>
        <h1>tools and technologies worked out as expected</h1>
        <p>We learn a lot from the tools and technologies like git, Trello, mybatis, spring boot and thymeleaf. All
            tools and technologies we used worked out as expected. However, thymeleaf is not compatible completely with
            javascript. We had to do a lot of research to avoid strange errors.
        </p>
        <h1>unanticipated events influence</h1>
        <p>There are several events which affect our progress. First is other courses’ assignments. We need to adjust
            our plan because of the impacts of other courses. Some group members have to delay the subtask due date.
            Second, we need to endure terrible connection speed with aws education because several group partners are in
            China. We spent lots of time waiting for responses.</p>
