            Motivation
        </h1>
        <p>
            Originally, we are trying to build a recipe sharing web application, which is mainly to offer ideas to
            people who have ingredients in their kitchen but don't know what to cook. After having a meeting with Dr.B,
            we agree with doing some adjustments to this idea, which backward the procedure of the original idea. The
            website will let users choose ingredients first and it will recommend recipes accordingly. Due to the fact
            that our group has not done any web application before, it is challenging enough to endeavour to achieve
            this project. However, our group has all the necessary knowledge to do this project. Some of us are good at
            HTML, CSS, JS which benefits building front-end and some of us are fond of coding which helps back-end. We
            all have experience with Java and choose Spring Boot as a new tool to code. And we all know about database
            concepts and could have collaborative teamwork with building a well-organized database. As a result, our
            group chooses this topic as our project.

        <h1>Aim and Goals</h1>

        <p>In the current Covid-19 epidemic situation in most countries. People are restricted from going out and that
            greatly affects the quality of their meals. The project we decided to implement is a food and recipe
            application that organizes a list of recipes based on the ingredients in the user's kitchen. It is expected
            to solve the problem of not knowing how to use the ingredients at home and providing ideas on what to cook.
            The application will have several goals as below to achieve the above aim.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>ACCOUNT SYSTEM</h2>
                User can easily change to the registration page in the login page. After creating an account, users can
                log in, logout, manage the profile. Furthermore, they can post and edit the recipes or comment on other
                recipes. We provide a profile card and users can modify their personal information. In this feature,
                users can have their account to access more functions, such as posting recipes, managing recipes and
                writing a comment for a recipe. In addition, only registered users can save and collect their favourite
                recipes.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>SLIDER</h2>
                Users can select a slider picture and navigate to the recipe page directly. The slider is shown on the
                homepage which has four pages, and they are the best four liked recipes of the website. The slider can
                switch the pages automatically and users can also switch pages by clicking the button under the slices.
                Furthermore, the user can access the recipe detail page directly by simply clicking the picture.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>KITCHEN AND PANTRY SYSTEM </h2>
                Users can go to the profile page to access the pantry function. In the pantry page, the user can input
                the ingredient’s name and select the ingredient. When the user touches the search recipes button. The
                system will return related recipes. Registered users can record what ingredient users have in the real
                kitchen like ingredients so that the system can recommend a suitable website by those ingredients.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>RECIPE THUMBNAIL </h2>
                Users can quickly select recipes from recipe thumbnails and register users can directly like or save the
                recipes. This feature allows users to select what recipe they need rapidly. We provide a small recipe
                card with the title, author and its tags. Registered users also can directly like the recipe through the
                “like” button and save the recipe through a save button.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
                Each recipe will have detailed descriptions of ingredients and cooking methods. Besides, step-by-step
                instructions with pictures will be applied to help the user to cook. Step-by-step instructions page
                should contain three parts which are recipe information, ingredients and instructions. For the first
                part, this section will show the user the recipe photo and its author. All the related tags will be
                shown as well. If users want to see more of similar recipes, they can click on the tag. The website will
                look through the database again and show the recipes containing this tag. The second part is
                ingredients, all the specific names and amounts will be shown. Besides, this part is designed to be a
                checkbox which users could check if they have those ingredients. For the last part is instructions,
                detailed steps will be offered with pictures. Users could use those for references.


            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>TAGS AND SEARCHING</h2>
                Users can touch recommended tags or type in a recipe’s name or an ingredient’s name to search for a
                recipe. To help users find their suitable recipes, tags will be used in recipes. Those tags may contain
                key ingredients. Users will have a more pleasing searching experience because tags help them to target
                recipes more precisely. Tags are also structured in the system. The system provides different kinds of
                tags to help the user to find what they want rapidly. In the result page, the user can directly save
                recipes through the save button and see more about the recipe.


            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>UPLOAD AND MANAGE POSTS</h2>
                We provide excellent UX and let users upload their recipe. Users can add title, upload cover picture,
                add a description, add ingredients, add steps with a picture to describe the recipe in detail. We also
                provide an option to allow the user to save as a draft. Users can post and share the recipes. When
                posting the recipes, it is required to provide the title, ingredients, steps and pictures for the steps.
                Users can add tags for the recipes to make sure that recipes can be searched easily by the tags. For
                example, if the key Ingredient of a recipe is the egg, then the egg can be one of the tags. Furthermore,
                if the user believes that salt flavour is special for the recipe, he or she can also add 'salt' in the
                tags area. Managed recipes are the feature that users can edit or delete the recipe if they wish.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Scope</h1>
        <p>We have identified the following features that will form the working prototype of the application. They are
            listed in order, from the most basic functions to the extended functions. The first seven features are in
            the timeline, and the last five are completed as time permits.
