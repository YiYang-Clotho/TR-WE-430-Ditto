          <b>Background and passion: <br /> </b>I am an international student from China. This is my third year of being a student of computer science and IT. At the beginning, I chose IT for my major because I was interested in developing games. However, after two and half a year of study, I find that many aspects are worth learning such as data analysis and algorithm design. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Current ability:<br /> </b>Have learned C, HTML, CSS, python, java and Ruby on Rails. Have experiences of web design and development. I prefer back-end development more than front-end design. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Weak points:<br /> </b> Find it hard to start a project from the first beginning because in the project that I attended before, there always be tutors give the guidance or lead me understand the project. I don’t have much experience of working on a project from the first beginning. So, during this project, I am willing to spend more time on development and build up the back end of the website. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The areas in need of development:</b>
          <br />
           As a member of a group, communication is very important. I prefer to communicate more with other members during the progress of project no matter we meet issues, or we made any achievement. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Challenges:</b> <br />
          Design a logical database with less coupling and high cohesion is quite a challenge for this project because we should consider many things such as the attributes in each table and the relationship between tables. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Tasks:</b>  <br />
            coding, database design and review others’ work
