          <b>Background and passion: <br /> </b> I am an overseas student from
          China. Now it’s my second year of Bachelor of IT. I had some coding
          experience when I was in China. In the IT industry, I always find
          analyzing data interesting. It is magical finding a regular pattern by
          analyzing enormous and distributed data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Current ability:<br /> </b> I have already studied several coding
          languages, including C, Java, and Python. Currently, I am studying
          C++. Except for those, I have a certain understanding of C# and HTML,
          CSS on building a web application. For my interest, I find the
          back-end more appealing because I like coding more than designing the
          front- end site.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Weak points:<br /> </b> Although I learned several coding
          languages, I rarely have an opportunity to put those into practice. I
          wish I could train my coding and problem-solving skills through this
          project.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The areas in need of development:</b>
          <br />
          Designing is one of them needing further development, it could be
          frustrating to me if I lost patience in adjusting the framework of a
          website. Patience is another one in which I may have a lagging
          problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Challenges:</b> <br />
          Designing a well-organized database is one of the challenges because
          this project demands many functions and different entities. Learning
          new tools is hard as well, this project involves several new
          java-based tools I am not familiar with like spring boot. Coding is
          another one because some of this project’s features are complex and
          require more time coding and testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Tasks:</b>  <br />
          I could help with writing user stories, designing a database,
          programming features.
