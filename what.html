        <h2>1.Description</h2>
        <p>
          In the current Covid-19 epidemic situation in most countries,
          especially in Australia, people are restricted from going out and that
          greatly affects the quality of their meals. The project we decided to
          implement is a food and recipe application that organizes a list of
          recipes based on the ingredients in the user’s kitchen. It hopes to
          solve the problem of not knowing how to use the ingredients at home
          and providing ideas on what to cook it when you have no specific
          ideas. By doing so, we hope to save million tons of food wastage
          issue, support user to save money from ordering food from restaurants
          and provide a user-friendly interface that users of all ages can
          enjoy.
          <p><b>High level user story: <br></b> <b> As a</b> user, 
            I want to know which recipe I can use to cook with ingredients in my pantry and I can order online if I don’t have some of the required ingredients 
            <b><br> so that </b> I can better prepare daily meals for me and my family and save the time as well. </p>
        </p>
        <h2>2.Demonstrable Outcomes</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Project Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          This is an upgrade project from the existing applications. We have
          found their missing points and decided to improve them with this
          recipe application project. They are not only suitable for all ages
          but also provide the best support for them. Other apps like Tasty or
          Yummly only offer available menus and force users to follow them in
          order to cook the best food. Our app is pretty much the same, which
          makes a difference and is also the purpose of the app is to help users
          find the recipe they want to cook with everything in their pantry.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a project that oriented towards database management. We
          learned about them in year 1 so we can properly apply it to this
          project. Plus, this project is about web editing and designing as the
          main part of this course, therefore, each person needs to develop
          their own coding and managing skills for each stage of the app
          development.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Project Justification</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Workload</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Expectation:</b> We plan to meet once every 3-4 business days to
          assign work to each person based on their knowledge and strengths. We
          will divide them into different parts of the project such as
          designing, site coding, workspace managing, annotating and general
          managing. <br />
          <b>Reality:</b> Basically, everything is on the track up to now. The
          only thing that is limited is the meeting on Teams. We have different
          schedules, so it is difficult to choose a time for people to
          participate in discussions and suggestions on the project. However, we
          have already finished assigning in the first group meeting and
          everyone also tried to complete their part well.

        <h3>3.2 Beyond Current Capabilities</h3>
        <!-- TODO Beyond Current Capabilities -->
        <p>We have not created a web app before</p>
        <h3>3.3 Risks</h3>
        <ol>
          <h4>team dynamics risk</h4>
          <li>
            <b>Risk:</b>
            Do not have enough time to finish all the features.
            <br />
            <b>Example: </b>Our group may face hard technological problems.
            <br />
            <b>Mitigation:</b>Ask the lecturer or the tutor. More communication
            to decrease the number of unreachable features.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Risk:</b>
            Suddenly or unpredictable requirements are adding
            <br />
            <b>Example: </b>we may forget to add a vital function to the
            application.<br />
            <b>Mitigation:</b>do more communication and learn more about how to
            build a system
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Risk:</b>
            Limited knowledge reserve lead to the delay our project’s progress.
            <br />
            <b>Example: </b>we may have no idea to achieve the background side.
            <br />
            <b>Mitigation:</b>learn more or delete difficult features
          </li>
          <br />
          <h4>project risks</h4>
          <li>
            <b>Risk:</b>
            Recipe content
            <br />
            <b>Example: </b> recipe content cannot be shown properly.<br />
            <b>Mitigation:</b>learn more html and css technology.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Risk:</b>
            Concurrency control
            <br />
            <b>Example: </b> Overloaded server<br />
            <b>Mitigation:</b>Minimize main database but still keep the
            flexibility and the algorithms that used for the main function.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Risk:</b>
            Content control/authorization
            <br />
            <b>Example: </b> The workload for administrators is huge.<br />
            <b>Mitigation:</b>Implement the authorization program which can
            check each post that user going to upload, and the checking process
            will be taken over by cooperated chefs
