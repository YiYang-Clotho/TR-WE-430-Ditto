      <h2>1.Description</h2>
      <p>
        In the current Covid-19 epidemic situation in most countries, especially in Australia, people are restricted
        from going out and that greatly affects the quality of their meals. The project we decided
        to implement is a food and recipe application that organizes a list of recipes based on the ingredients
        in the user's kitchen. It is expected to solve the problem of not knowing how to use the ingredients at
        home and providing ideas on what to cook.


      <p><b>High level user story: <br></b> <b> As a</b> user,
        I want to know which recipe I can use to cook with ingredients in my pantry and I can order online if I don’t
        have some of the required ingredients
        <b><br> so that </b> I can better prepare daily meals for me and my family and save the time as well. </p>
      </p>
      <h2>2.Demonstrable Outcomes</h2>
      <h3>2.1 Project Motivation</h3>
      <p>
        This is an upgrade project from the existing applications. We have
        found their missing points and decided to improve them with this
        recipe application project. They are not only suitable for all ages
        but also provide the best support for them. Other apps like Tasty or
        Yummly only offer available menus and force users to follow them in
        order to cook the best food. Our app is pretty much the same, which
        makes a difference and is also the purpose of the app is to help users
        find the recipe they want to cook with everything in their pantry.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a project that oriented towards database management. We
        learned about them in year 1 so we can properly apply it to this
        project. Plus, this project is about web editing and designing as the
        main part of this course, therefore, each person needs to develop
        their own coding and managing skills for each stage of the app
        development.

          <b> Tags and searching: </b><br />

          To help users find their suitable recipes, tags will be used in
          recipes. Those tags may contain key ingredients. Users will have a
          more pleasing searching experience because tags help them to target
          recipes more precisely.

      <h3>3.3 Risks</h3>
      <ol>
        <h4>team dynamics risk</h4>
        <li>
          <b>Risk:</b>
          Do not have enough time to finish all the features.
          <br />
          <b>Example: </b>Our group may face hard technological problems.
          <br />
          <b>Mitigation:</b>Ask the lecturer or the tutor. More communication
          to decrease the number of unreachable features.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Risk:</b>
          Suddenly or unpredictable requirements are adding
          <br />
          <b>Example: </b>we may forget to add a vital function to the
          application.<br />
          <b>Mitigation:</b>do more communication and learn more about how to
          : Build a system
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Risk:</b>
          Limited knowledge reserve lead to the delay our project’s progress.
          <br />
          <b>Example: </b>we may have no idea to achieve the background side.
          <br />
          <b>Mitigation:</b>learn more or delete difficult features
        </li>
        <br />
        <h4>project risks</h4>
        <li>
          <b>Risk:</b>
          Recipe content
          <br />
          <b>Example: </b> recipe content cannot be shown properly.<br />
          <b>Mitigation:</b>learn more html and css technology.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Risk:</b>
          Concurrency control
          <br />
          <b>Example: </b> Overloaded server<br />
          <b>Mitigation:</b>Minimize main database but still keep the
          flexibility and the algorithms that used for the main function.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Risk:</b>
          Content control/authorization
          <br />
          <b>Example: </b> The workload for administrators is huge.<br />
          <b>Mitigation:</b>Implement the authorization program which can
          check each post that user going to upload, and the checking process
          will be taken over by cooperated chefs
