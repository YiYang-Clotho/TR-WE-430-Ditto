      <h2>1.Description</h2>
      <!-- STUB: done -->
      <p>
        In the current Covid-19 epidemic situation in most countries. People are restricted from going out and that greatly affects the quality of their meals. The project we decided to implement is a food and recipe application that organizes a list of recipes based on the ingredients in the user's kitchen. It is expected to solve the problem of not knowing how to use the ingredients at home and providing ideas on what to cook. 


      <p><b>High level user story: <br></b> <b> As a</b> user,
        I want to know which recipe I can use to cook with ingredients in my pantry and I can order online if I
        do not
        have some of the required ingredients
        <b><br> so that </b> I can better prepare daily meals for me and my family and save the time as well. </p>
      </p>
      <h2>2.Demonstrable Outcomes</h2>
      <h3>2.1 Project Motivation</h3>
      <p>This is an upgrade project extended from the Gia's Introduction to IT's project. Originally, we are trying to build a recipe sharing web application, which is mainly to offer ideas to people who have ingredients in their kitchen but don't know what to cook. After having a meeting with Dr.B, we agree with doing some adjustments to this idea, which backward the procedure of the original idea. The website will let users choose ingredients first and it will recommend recipes accordingly. Due to the fact that our group has not done any web application before, it is challenging enough to endeavor to achieve this project. However, our group has all the necessary knowledge to do this project. Some of us are good at HTML, CSS, JS which benefits building front-end and some of us are fond of coding which helps back-end. We all have experience with Java and choose Spring Boot as a new tool to code. And we all know about database concepts and could have collaborative teamwork with building a well-organized database. As a result, our group chooses this topic as our project. </p>

          <b>Risk:</b>
          Do not have enough time to finish all the features.
          <br />
          <b>Example: </b>Our group may face hard technological problems.
          <br />
          <b>Mitigation:</b>Ask the lecturer or the tutor. More communication
          to decrease the number of unreachable features.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Risk:</b>
          Suddenly or unpredictable requirements are adding
          <br />
          <b>Example: </b>we may forget to add a vital function to the
          application.<br />
          <b>Mitigation:</b>do more communication and learn more about how to
          : Build a system
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Risk:</b>
          Limited knowledge reserve lead to the delay our project’s progress.
          <br />
          <b>Example: </b>we may have no idea to achieve the background side.
          <br />
          <b>Mitigation:</b>learn more or delete difficult features
        </li>
        <br />
        <h4>project risks</h4>
        <li>
          <b>Risk:</b>
          Recipe content
          <br />
          <b>Example: </b> recipe content cannot be shown properly.<br />
          <b>Mitigation:</b>learn more html and css technology.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Risk:</b>
          Concurrency control
          <br />
          <b>Example: </b> Overloaded server<br />
          <b>Mitigation:</b>Minimize main database but still keep the
          flexibility and the algorithms that used for the main function.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Risk:</b>
          Content control/authorization
          <br />
          <b>Example: </b> The workload for administrators is huge.<br />
          <b>Mitigation:</b>Implement the authorization program which can
          check each post that user going to upload, and the checking process
          will be taken over by cooperated chefs
