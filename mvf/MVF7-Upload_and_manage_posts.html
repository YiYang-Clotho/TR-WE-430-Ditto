      <h2>2.Explanation</h2>
      <h3>2.1 Description</h3>
      <p style="color: black;">
        <ul>
          <li>Users can post and share the recipes. When posting the recipes, it is required to provide the title,
            ingredients, steps and pictures for the steps. Users can add tags for the recipes to make sure that
            recipes can be searched easily by the tags. For example, if the key Ingredient of a recipe is the egg,
            then egg can be one of the tags. Furthermore, if the user believes that salt flavor is special for
            the recipe, he or she can also add 'salt' in the tags area. Mange recipes is the feature that users can
            edit or delete the recipe if they wish.</li>
